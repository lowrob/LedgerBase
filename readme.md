Old code I have from a financial system that was writen in the late 80's, early 90's.  Need to recover more of the files but this is the start of what I have found so far.  

This code was ran on a server and vt100 was used to access the system.  It had a isam DB.  Will fill in more info if I can reocover the software from old tapes and drives.

dbh = database code and utilities.
