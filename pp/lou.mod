L.Robichaud	97/05/20	In about April I add code to this program to 
			recognize a S11 and S12 attendance code to e for a half
			day sick and a full day sick accordingly.  This was 
			added for the employees of the Avalon East School Board.
			Today I added the code needed to recognize a V11 and a 
			V12 for vacations in the same manner.
