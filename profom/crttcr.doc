		   SET UP TERMINAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR PROFOM
		   ==========================================

FILES TO BE REFERED:
===================

	1. "/etc/termcap" file for the corresponding terminal capabilities.
	2. "crttcr.c" file of PROFOM and if required "cfomtcr.h".
	3. Terminal manual if any.

RELATION between TERMCAP entries and the structure members of TCRFIX of PROFOM:
==============================================================================

	TCRFIX member	TERMCAP entry			Remark
	-------------	-------------			------
	ttyp				It's value is 1 if it's a dynamic
					terminal, 2 for a terminal with no
					video attribute facility otherwise 0.
	lines		li		Number of lines on screen.
	cols		co		Number of columns in a line.
	wrap		am		It's presence in the termcap, indicates
					that the terminal has auto wrap facility
					and if so it is set to 1 else 0.
	ceol		ce		Clear to end of line.
	clin		ce/cd		Clear to end of line/display.
	cscrn		cl		Clear screen.
	left		kl		Move left/left arrow.
	right		kr		Move right/right arrow.
	up		ku/up		Move up/up arrow.
	down		kd/do		Move down/down arrow.
	home		kh/ho		Home.
	sfa				Begin reverse/underline video mode.
					e.g:	In case of 7901 he calls it as
						"setting tagged data"    (so).
	efa		se/ue		End the corr. modes.
					e.g:	In case of 7901 he calls it as
						"resetting tagged data"  (si).
	rv		so		Reverse video sequence.
	uline		us		Underline video sequence.

	hiten		|		Not supported in termcap, but if
			|------------>	available in any manual you can use
	loten		|		these sequences.

	The following refer to cursor motion capability:

			cm		Cursor motion/Position cursor.
					SYNTAX For 7901:
						cm=\EY%+ %+ :

	move				Any sequence of characters after escape
					character('\E') and the first '%'.
	movesep				Any character between X & Y coordinates.
					e.g:	cm=\EY%+ ;%+ :
						so here it's the character ';'.
	xy				If %r is present in the 'cm' string, it
					should be set to 1 else 0.
					e.g:	cm=\E%r%+ %+ :
	const				ASCII value of the character present
					after %+.
					e.g:	Above it's '%+ ', so add 32
						as it's the ascii value of the
						blank character.

HOW TO GO ABOUT CREATING ?
========================
	1. Edit the crttcr.c file with the following details.
	2. Fill the details of TCRFIX structure members with corr. capabilities
	   present in the TERMCAP file or corr. terminal manual as explained
	   above( code as shown in the crttcr.c file ).
	3. Take care when using the functions sc(), stc() & sce() provided in
	   crttcr.c file.
		sc() :	It puts the control character corr. to the char passed.
		stc():	Appends the string passed.
		sce():	Prefixes ESC character to the string passed.
